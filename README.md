## Description

This projects intends to teach the fundamentals of basics functions and libraries, and build an usable library for myself as well.

Functions added to the library (descriptions from "__man__" and from __Subject__):

* __ft_isalpha__:
  * int ft_isalpha(int c) - checks for an alphabetic character; in the standard "C" locale, it  is  equivalent  to (isupper(_c_)  ||  islower(_c_)).
  
* __ft_isdigit__:
  * int ft_isdigit(int c) - checks for a digit (0 through 9).

* __ft_isalnum__:
  * int ft_isalnum(int c) - checks for an alphanumeric character; it is equivalent to (isalpha(_c_) || isdigit(_c_)).

* __ft_isascii__:
  * int ft_isascii(int c) - checks whether _c_ is a 7-bit unsigned char value that fits  into  the  ASCII  character set.

* __ft_isprint__:
  * int ft_isprint(int c) - checks for any printable character including space.

* __ft_strlen__:
  * size_t ft_strlen(const char *s) - calculates the length of the string pointed to by _s_, excluding the terminating null byte ('\0').

* __ft_memset__:
  * void *ft_memset(void \*s, int c, size_t n) - fills the first _n_ bytes of the memory area pointed to by _s_ with the constant byte _c_, and returns a pointer to the memory area _s_.

* __ft_bzero__:
  * void ft_bzero(void *s, size_t n) - erases the data in the _n_ bytes of the memory starting at the location pointed to by _s_, by writing zeros (bytes containing '\0') to that area.

* __ft_memcpy__:
  * void *ft_memcpy(void \*dest, const void \*src, size_t n) - copies _n_ bytes from memory area _src_ to memory area _dest_. The memory areas must not overlap.

* __ft_memmove__:
  * void *ft_memmove(void \*dest, const void \*src, size_t n) - copies _n_ bytes from memory area _src_ to memory area _dest_. The memory areas may overlap: copying takes place as though the bytes in _src_ are first copied into a temporary  array  that  does  not overlap _src_ or _dest_, and the bytes are then copied from the temporary array to _dest_.

* __ft_strlcpy:__
  * size_t ft_strlcpy(char *dst, const char \*src, size_t dsize) - copy the input string into a destination  string. If the destination buffer, limited by its size, isn't large enough to hold the copy, the resulting string is  truncated (but it is guaranteed to be null-terminated). They return the length of the total string they tried to create.

* __ft_strlcat__:
  * size_t ft_strlcat(char *dst, const char \*src, size_t dsize) - catenate the input string into a destination  string. If the destination buffer, limited by its size, isn't large enough to hold the copy, the resulting string is  truncated (but it is guaranteed to be null-terminated). They return the length of the total string they tried to create. If _dsize_ isn't longer than the original _dst_ string, this function returns _dstsize_ + (size of _src_).

* __ft_toupper__:
  * int ft_toupper(int c) - if _c_ is a lowercase letter, returns its uppercase equivalent, if an uppercase representation exists in the current locale. Otherwise, it returns _c_.

* __ft_tolower__:
  * int ft_tolower(int c) - if _c_ is an uppercase letter, returns its lowercase equivalent, if a lowercase representation exists in the current locale. Otherwise, it returns _c_.

* __ft_strchr__:
  * char *ft_strchr(const char \*s, int c) - returns  a pointer to the first occurrence of the character _c_ in the string _s_, or NULL if the character is not found. The terminating null byte is considered part of the string, so that if _c_ is specified as '\0', this function return a pointer to the terminator.

* __ft_strrchr__:
  * char *ft_strrchr(const char \*s, int c) - returns  a pointer to the last occurrence of the character _c_ in the string _s_, or NULL if the character is not found. The terminating null byte is considered part of the string, so that if _c_ is specified as '\0', this function return a pointer to the terminator.

* __ft_strncmp__:
  * int ft_strncmp(const char *s1, const char \*s2, size_t n) - compares the two strings _s1_ and _s2_. It compares only the first (at most) _n_ bytes, using unsigned characters. Returns an integer indicating the result of the comparison, as follows:

    * 0, if the s1 and s2 are equal;

    * a negative value if s1 is less than s2;

    * a positive value if s1 is greater than s2.

* __ft_memchr__:
  * void *ft_memchr(const void \*s, int c, size_t n) - scans the initial _n_ bytes of the memory area pointed to by _s_ for the first instance of _c_. Both _c_ and the bytes of the memory area pointed to by _s_ are interpreted as unsigned char.

* __ft_memcmp__:
  * int ft_memcmp(const void *s1, const void \*s2, size_t n) - compares the first _n_ bytes (each interpreted as unsigned char) of the memory areas _s1_ and _s2_. Returns an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if the first _n_ bytes of _s1_ is found, respectively, to be less than, to match, or be greater than the first _n_ bytes of _s2_. For a nonzero return value, the sign is determined by the sign of the difference between the first pair of bytes (interpreted as unsigned char) that differ in _s1_ and _s2_. If _n_ is zero, the return value is zero.

* __ft_strnstr__:
  * char *ft_strnstr(const char \*haystack, const char \*needle, size_t len) - scans the first _len_ bytes for the  first occurrence of the substring _needle_ in the string _haystack_. The terminating null bytes ('\0') are not compared.

* __ft_atoi__:
  * int ft_atoi(const char *nptr) - converts the initial portion of the string pointed to by _nptr_ to int. The string may begin with an arbitrary amount of white space ('\f', '\n', '\r', '\t', '\v' or space) followed by a single optional '+' or '-' sign.

* __ft_calloc__:
  * void *ft_calloc(size_t nmemb, size_t size) - allocates memory for an array of _nmemb_ elements of _size_ bytes each and returns a pointer to the allocated memory.  The memory is set to zero.  If _nmemb_ or _size_ is 0, then it returns a unique pointer value that can later be successfully passed to free().

* __ft_strdup__:
  * char *ft_strdup(const char \*s) - returns a pointer to a new string which is a duplicate of the string _s_. Memory for the new string is obtained with malloc(), and can be freed with free(). On success, the function returns a pointer to the duplicated string. It returns NULL if insufficient memory was available.

* __ft_substr__:
  * char *ft_substr(char const \*s, unsigned int start, size_t len) - allocates memory (using malloc()) and returns a substring from the string _’s’_. The substring starts at index _'start’_ and has a maximum length of _’len’_.

* __ft_strjoin__:
  * char *ft_strjoin(char const \*s1, char const \*s2) - allocates memory (using malloc()) and returns a new string, which is the result of concatenating _’s1’_  and _’s2’_.

* __ft_strtrim__:
  * char *ft_strtrim(char const \*s1, char const \*set) - allocates memory (using malloc()) and returns a copy of _’s1’_ with characters from _’set’_ removed from the beginning and the end.
  
* __ft_split__:
  * char **ft_split(char const *s, char c) - allocates memory (using malloc()) and returns an array of strings obtained by splitting _’s’_ using the character _’c’_ as a delimiter. The array must end with a NULL pointer.

* __ft_itoa__:
  * char *ft_itoa(int n) - allocates memory (using malloc()) and returns a string representing the integer received as an argument. Negative numbers must be handled.

* __ft_strmapi__:
  * char \*ft_strmapi(char const \*s, char (*f)(unsigned int, char)) - Applies the function _f_ to each character of the string _s_, passing its index as the first argument and the character itself as the second. A new string is created (using malloc()) to store the results from the successive applications of _f_.

* __ft_striteri__:
  * void ft_striteri(char *s, void (\*f)(unsigned int, char\*)) - applies the function _’f’_ to each character of the string passed as argument, passing its index as the first argument. Each character is passed by address to _’f’_ so it can be modified if necessary.

* __ft_putchar_fd__:
  * void ft_putchar_fd(char c, int fd) - outputs the character _’c’_ to the specified file descriptor.

* __ft_putstr_fd__:
  * void ft_putstr_fd(char *s, int fd) - outputs the string _’s’_ to the specified file descriptor.

* __ft_putendl_fd__:
  * void ft_putendl_fd(char *s, int fd) - outputs the string _’s’_ to the specified file descriptor followed by a newline.

* __ft_putnbr_fd__:
  * void ft_putnbr_fd(int n, int fd) - outputs the integer _’n’_ to the specified file descriptor.

* __ft_lstnew__:
  * t_list *ft_lstnew(void \*content) - allocates memory (using malloc()) and returns a new node. The _’content’_ member variable is initialized with the given parameter _’content’_. The variable _’next’_ is initialized to NULL.

* __ft_lstadd_front__:
  * void ft_lstadd_front(t_list **lst, t_list *new) - adds the node _’new’_ at the beginning of the list.

* __ft_lstsize__:
  * int ft_lstsize(t_list *lst) - counts the number of nodes in the list.

* __ft_lstlast__:
  * t_list *ft_lstlast(t_list \*lst) - returns the last node of the list.

* __ft_lstadd_back__:
  * void ft_lstadd_back(t_list **lst, t_list *new) - adds the node _’new’_ at the end of the list.

* __ft_lstdelone__:
  * void ft_lstdelone(t_list \*lst, void (\*del)(void*)) - takes a node as parameter and frees its content using the function _’del’_. Free the node itself but does NOT free the next node.

* __ft_lstclear__:
  * void ft_lstclear(t_list **lst, void (\*del)(void\*)) - deletes and frees the given node and all its successors, using the function _’del’_ and free(). Finally, set the pointer to the list to NULL.

* __ft_lstiter__:
  * void ft_lstiter(t_list \*lst, void (*f)(void \*)) - iterates through the list _’lst’_ and applies the function _’f’_ to the content of each node.

* __ft_lstmap__:
  * t_list \*ft_lstmap(t_list \*lst, void \*(*f)(void \*), void (*del)(void \*)) - iterates through the list _’lst’_, applies the function _’f’_ to each node’s content, and creates a new list resulting of the successive applications of the function _’f’_. The _’del’_ function is used to delete the content of a node if needed.
